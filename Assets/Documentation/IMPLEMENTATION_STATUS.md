# ClickCook Implementation Status

## Completed milestones

### Milestone 1 — ClickCook Data Foundation

Static ScriptableObject data for Locations and Dishes is implemented.

- `DishData`: documented numeric ID, English and Russian display names, sale value, recipe cost, click requirement, and explicitly documented location availability.
- `LocationData`: level requirement, English and Russian display names, passive income per second, and documented dish availability.
- 32 `DishData` assets and 11 `LocationData` assets are present.
- Bidirectional references are populated from the explicit **Known locations** entries in the GDD dish table.

### Milestone 2A — Runtime Location Catalog

A read-only `LocationCatalog` ScriptableObject provides a single, ordered runtime entry point for the 11 existing `LocationData` assets.

- The catalog preserves documented level order 0–10.
- `TryGetByDocumentedLevel` resolves a location by its documented level.
- The catalog contains no location-unlock, ownership, recipe-gating, order-generation, save/load, or gameplay logic.

### Milestone 2B — Location Selection to Work Day Prototype

`SampleScene` now contains a temporary uGUI prototype under `ClickCook_Prototype`.

- Location Selection is a left/right carousel over all 11 catalog locations, wrapping at either end.
- The displayed name, documented level, documented dish count, and income/sec update with the current location.
- Cook stores the current `LocationData` in an in-memory prototype session and opens a Work Day placeholder showing the selected location.
- Finish Day is a harmless prototype-only action that displays a placeholder message.
- The temporary scene UI and controller consistently use legacy `UnityEngine.UI.Text`; every serialized screen, label, button, and catalog reference is assigned.

#### Milestone 2B verification

- Unity 6000.3.14f1 compiles the milestone scripts without C# compilation failures.
- `LocationCatalog.asset` contains exactly 11 non-null `LocationData` references with documented levels 0–10 represented once each.
- Play Mode button-callback verification confirmed all 11 locations are browsable, Previous/Next wrap correctly, Cook opens Work Day with the selected location, and Finish Day displays its prototype-only response.
- `SampleScene` was saved with the prototype visible and the existing dormitory environment, lighting, and camera preserved.
- The Console still reports an unrelated Unity Version Control client configuration error because the local Plastic/UVCS client is not configured; no Milestone 2B runtime exception was observed.

## Intentionally unimplemented

- Location unlocking and ownership.
- Recipe ownership/gating.
- Order generation or an order board.
- Economy, rewards, XP, save/load, persistence, cooking, timers, scoring, final UI, and final animations.

## Known GDD ambiguities / TBDs retained

- The GDD separately describes new recipe groups and dishes served by locations; their precise relationship and recipe purchase gating are TBD.
- Several location descriptions use incomplete phrases such as “also serves selected ... dishes.” No extra dishes were inferred.
- The Michelin restaurant says “all dishes starting from the third restaurant,” which conflicts with / is less precise than its criteria dish list. No additional earlier dishes are inferred.
- The click requirement’s relationship to future hidden HP/progress remains TBD.
- Location ownership/unlock state, passive-income accrual/collection, recipes, order generation, and all other runtime rules remain unimplemented by design.

## Working tree note

- A pre-existing interrupted import under `Assets/TextMesh Pro/` remains untracked. Milestone 2B does not depend on it and this recovery did not add or modify TMP resources.
